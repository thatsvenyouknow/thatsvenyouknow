ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sven

I am a freshly graduated Neuroengineer from the Technical University in Munich (TUM) and currently located in Munich, Germany. 

My main interests are twofold:
1. I love to apply AI to the neuro and medical field in a pursuit to create a positive impact to the world. This ranges from reconstructing images from brain recordings to detecting pathologies from imaging data.
2. I am fascinated by the different facets of AI and love to a) re-build the latest methods from scratch to get a thorough understanding of how things work and b) think about smart ways of how to use and extend the techniques efficiently in various projects.

A flavor of 1. can be found in the [eegreconstruction](https://github.com/thatsvenyouknow/eegreconstruction) repository which contains the code that I have (completely) written during my time at the MIT Media Lab. 

For 2. I would like to invite you to check out the [ML_basics](https://github.com/thatsvenyouknow/ML_basics) repository in which I have coded several models from both, the predictive and generative AI field, from scratch or have applied state-of-the-art techniques to different use cases. Alternatively, you may explore some of my other (university) projects, too. 

ðŸ§  How to catch me: Non-trivial (ML) project ideas that are a) very impactful :rocket: and/or b) super cool :sunglasses:.
